# Task S1.02. Lambdas and Streams

## Level 1

> All exercises must use the Java 8+ Lambdas and Streams API.

### Exercise 1

Given a list of Strings, write a method that returns a list of all strings that contain the letter 'o'. Print the result.

### Exercise 2

Do the same as in the previous exercise, but now the method should return a list of Strings that not only contain the letter 'o' but also have more than 5 letters. Print the result.

### Exercise 3

Create a list with the names of the months of the year. Print all the elements of the list using a lambda expression.

### Exercise 4

Do the same print as in the previous exercise, but using method reference instead.

### Exercise 5

Create a Functional Interface with a method called `getPiValue()` that returns a `double`. From the `main()` method of the main class, instantiate the interface and assign it the value `3.1415`. Invoke the `getPiValue()` method and print the result.

### Exercise 6

Create a list with numbers and text strings, and sort the list from the shortest string to the longest.

### Exercise 7

Using the list from the previous exercise, now sort it in reverse: from the longest string to the shortest.

### Exercise 8

Create a Functional Interface that contains a method called `reverse()`. This method must receive and return a `String`. In the `main()` method of the main class, implement the method body using a lambda expression so that it returns the same string it receives, but reversed. Invoke the interface instance with a sample string and check if the result is correct.

## Technologies Used

I have used the following technologies for developing the exercises described:

- **JDK 17**: For implementing the Java solutions.
- **IntelliJ IDEA**: As the integrated development environment (IDE) for Java programming.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

markdown
Copy code
2. Open the project with IntelliJ IDEA.

## Execution

Run the `Main` class of any exercise.

## Contributions

The project ignores the following files and directories:
